# CardGame

The computer will simulate the dealer. When the game starts, 52 playing cards will be shuffled and the
player is given $100. At each round of the game, both the player and the dealer will be
given 3 cards (they are drawn from the top of the deck). Player will place his/her bet
(the amount must be integer). Then before the dealer opens the cards, the player has a
chance to draw AT MOST two cards from the top of the deck to replace any two of the
cards on hand and each card on hand can only be replaced ONCE. Player will lose the
bet if the dealer got a better hand (see below for explanation), otherwise the player wins
the same amount of money as his/her bet.
Rules to determine who has better cards:
J, Q, K are regarded as special cards.
Rule 1: The one with more special cards wins.
Rule 2: If both have the same number of special cards, add the face values of the other
card(s) and take the remainder after dividing the sum by 10. The one with a bigger
remainder wins. (Note: Ace = 1).
Rule 3: The dealer wins if both rule 1 and rule 2 cannot distinguish the winner
